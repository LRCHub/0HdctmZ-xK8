It's been raining for a week
I'm feeling so alone
I'm trying to get drunk, I'm trying to get stoned
It's been raining for a week
I'm trying to get drunk, I'm trying to get stoned
I'm feeling so alone

And in the night, I open the window
To see how the stars fade
Fade just for no reason
See how the stars fade
Fade just for no reason

It's been raining for a week
I'm feeling so alone
I'm trying to get drunk, I'm trying to get stoned
It's been raining for a week
I'm trying to get drunk, I'm trying to get stoned
I'm feeling so alone

And in the night, I open the window
To see how the stars fade
Fade just for no reason
See how the stars fade
Fade just for no reason

Been raining for a week
I'm feeling so alone
I'm trying to get drunk, I'm trying to get stoned
It's been raining for a week
I'm trying to get drunk, I'm trying to get stoned
I'm feeling so alone

And in the night, I open the window
To see how the stars fade
Fade just for no reason
See how the stars fade
Fade just for no reason

And in the night, I open the window
To see how the stars fade
Fade just for no reason
See how the stars fade
Fade just for no reason
